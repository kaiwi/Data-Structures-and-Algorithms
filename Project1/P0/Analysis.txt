Run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation)
Task0
O(1): This task only accesses single elements of each respective list.

Task1
O(2n+2): There are two lines executing only once (before for loop), yielding +2. There are one line executing twice (sliced tuple) inside the O(n) for loop, yielding 2n.

Task2
O(4n+1): There is one line executing only once (before loop), yielding +1. Worst-case (non-unique number), there are two lines executing twice (sliced tuple) inside the O(n) for loop, yielding 4n.

Task3
O(n log n + 2n + 10): PART A has 8 one line executions. n log n is added due to sorted(), 1n for list.index() to determine fixed area codes, and 1n for printing the results. PART B has 2 one line executions. 

Task4
O(n log n + 2n + 6): There are 6 one line executions. n log n is added due to the sorted(), 1n for for loop to build telemarketer list, and 1n for printing the results.
